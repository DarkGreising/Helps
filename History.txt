= 1.0.0 =

New exported function New-Helps creates help and optional localized data
templates for commands and providers. Removed obsolete Template-Help.ps1.

Converted localized files to UTF8.

= 1.0.0.rc4 =

New exported function Merge-Helps. It is used in order to merge the help table
of a base cmdlet with help tables of derived cmdlets. 'parameters' are merged;
child 'inputs', 'outputs', 'examples', 'links' are appended to the base; other
child values override base. In other words, help of derived cmdlets is derived
from base cmdlet help by Merge-Helps.

Helps-Help.ps1 (help script of this module) uses this approach.

= 1.0.0.rc3 =

Fixed wrong 'output' processing.

= 1.0.0.rc2 =

Provider help is supported as well as command help.
+ Provider template in Template-Help.ps1.
+ Provider help example TestProvider.dll-Help.ps1

Help scripts can accept parameters, e.g. UICulture looks useful in order to
build help for several cultures. Helps-Help.ps1 uses this approach.
+ Parameters parameter in Convert-Helps and Test-Helps.
+ en-US and ru-RU help files and resources.

= 1.0.0.rc1 =

Exported functions: Convert-Helps, Test-Helps. The others are internal.

Help script example 'code' values can be script blocks. They ensure valid
syntax (otherwise build fails) and enable syntax highlighting in many editors.

String 'code' values are still supported. One practical reason is deliberately
not valid syntax. Thus, string code snippets cannot be tested by 'test' blocks.

= 1.0.0.rc0 =

The first release candidate.
